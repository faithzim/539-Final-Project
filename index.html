        <h2> What is this place? </h2>
        <p>
            Great question! My name is Faith Zimmerman, and I love media in basically all forms. I also love matching my
            media to the vibe of the season. So this site contains some of my favorite books, movies, tv shows, and
            musicals for each season.
        </p>

        <h2> So everything here is set in the season it's categorized as? </h2>
        <p>
            Nope! I've placed the pieces of media in the season that I think they're best consumed in. Sometimes that
            matches the season that they're set in but sometimes it does not. What matters is the vibe, not the literal
            setting of the story.

        <h2> Are the recommendations family friendly? </h2>
        <p>
            To stay true to my own interests and favorite pieces of media, many of the things on this list are not
            appropiate for kids.
        </p>

        <h2> Have you read/watched/listened to everything on the site? </h2>
        <p>
            Yes! I wouldn't recommend anything I haven't consumed myself.
        </p>

        <h2> Cool, I'm ready to get started.</h2>
        <p>
            Awesome! Click on one of the season buttons below or the navigation links at the top of the page to get into
            it!

        <h2>I looked at your list, and I furiously disagree with one of your categorizations. </h2>
        <p>
            Ah yes, I thought this might happen. I am not the authority on vibes, and I just categorized them based
            on
            my own personal preference. That said, I do have some recourse for you. Go ahead and fill out this form
            and
            explain why you think I'm wrong. I will take a look and carefully consider your criticism.
