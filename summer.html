                <h3> P.S. I Hate You<br>by Lauren Connolly </h3>
                <img src="images/PS.jpg"
                    alt="Cover of P.S. I Hate You, puzzle pieces with letters, landmarks, and a man and a woman looking at each other.">
                <p>
                    This story takes place over a few years in every different season, but I think it gives distinctly
                    summer vibes. It's about grief and love and what it means to move on. It's incredibly sweet and
                    compulsively readable.

                <h3>On The Fence<br>by Kasie West</h3>
                <img src="images/fence.jpg" alt="Cover of On The Fence, two teens embracing and kissing on a bridge.">
                <p>
                    I love most of what Kasie West writes; she's always good for a feel-good, compulsively readable,
                    cute little romance. Charlie and Braden find solace with each other chatting over the fence in the
                    middle of the night. This book feels like fireflies and cookouts.

                    alt="Cover of Daughter of the Pirate King, a girl is pirate garb with a sword hidden behind her back.">
                <p>
                    Pirates are always a win, especially in the summer. This high-seas adventure with a fiesty heroine
                    and an adorable enemies-to-lovers romance is ideal for the long days of summer. Once your done,
                    you'll want to get out on the lake.

                <h3> The Little Mermaid (Live Action)</h3>
                <img src="images/littlemermaid.jpeg"
                    alt="Cover of The Little Mermaid, a sea witch, king merman, and mermaid in an undersea environment.">
                <p>
                    I know everyone hates the live action Disney remakes, but the live action Little Mermaid is one of
                    my favorite movies. Both versions of the story are so whimsical and magical, absolutely perfect for
                    summer. If you haven't given the live action a chance, do it for me and my younger self. And once
                    you're done watching, I encourage you head to the pool or beach to play mermaids!

                    alt="Cover of Family Pack, six people in medieval clothes with the Werewolves of Millers Hollow logo behind them">
                <p>
                    You will have fun with this movie whether you've played Werewolves or not. Think Jumanji, a family
                    pulled into a board game, except the goal of the game is to use your superpowers to find the
                    werewolves before they kill you. It's a low-budget French movie, but it's made with so much love
                    that I can't help but love it.

                <p>
                    This is my favorite movie because it is perfect rom-com goodness. This was also the first movie I'd
                    seen with Glen Powell in it, and we all know he's aged well. Two assistants endeavor to set up their
                    high-strung bosses and face the consequences. Light, cute, perfect.

                <p>
                    If you've never seen an episode of Psych, you don't know what you're missing. This show is hilarious
                    and so so fun. The general premise is that a hyper observant man with a photographic memory pretends
                    to be a psychic to help the police solve murders. I know, bonkers. Bonkers and amazing.

                <p>
                    If you haven't seen Mamma Mia!, you've at least heard several of the songs. This one is worth seeing
                    on stage. Beachy both in setting and vibe, Mamma Mia provides a warm and ridiculous escape from any
                    possible woes.

                <p>
                    Lin Manuel Miranda is super famous at this point, but his freshman musical isn't quite as
                    well-known. It should be. Set in Washington Heights in New York City during the height of summer,
                    this musical is the perfect summertime watch. It'll make you feel alive and long for a nice cold
                    piragua.
