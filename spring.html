                <p>
                    This book was popular a while ago for good reason. The writing and story are beautiful, reminding
                    readers to fall in love with the world, regardless of if everything turns out well or not. This book
                    pumps hope straight into your veins and is perfect for defrosting from a cold winter.

                <p>
                    The only non-fiction on this list, Anthropocene Reviewed can only be described as gorgeous. The
                    essays are quick and full of John Green's humor and hope. He narrates the audiobook, so I recommend
                    that as well; his soothing voice underscores his relentless optisism.

                <p>
                    I was considering putting Station Eleven in the winter category, but the hope it left me with pulled
                    it into spring. This pre, inter, and post apocalyptic story weaves together a wonderful cast of
                    characters and reminds us of the beauty of the world and why we bother to live through the hard
                    parts of life.

                    alt="Cover of The Wild Robot, a robot hand and head peaking through the trees peering at the viewer.">
                <p>
                    This is a kids' movie, but I cried through basically the entire third act. Adapted from a book, this
                    movie follows a home robot crashed on a wilderness island who learns how to be a mother. Everything
                    about this film is beautiful from the animation to the score and the humanity of the film is so real
                    that it bleeds. I promise that it's worth your time.

                <p>
                    I love everything about this movie. Following an old woman who is scammed and will not stand for it,
                    the story is filled with adventure and heart. It reflects on what it means to be old and young and
                    reminds viewers that we're all just doing out best. You'll be reminded of someone in your life,
                    guaranteed.

                <p>
                    This kids' movie had absolutely no business being as good as it was. Packed with whimsy and
                    reflections on family, this story brings a young bear and a proper Britich family together. Watch it
                    with your kids and your friends alike and feel your heart thaw out.

                <p>
                    More serious, this show is an adaptation of the Anne of Green Gables books. It follows a spunky and
                    imaginative young orphan, the family she finds, and the friends she makes as she learns and grows
                    into a young woman. Watch Anne come of age as the snow melts.

                <p>
                    Based on the also-amazing movie, this musical is one of my absolute favorites. The songs are so fun,
                    and there's even a hilariously poor-quality MTV recording to watch if you can't make it to the
                    theater (no pirating involved). Follow Elle on her pink-tinted rise through law school and learn
                    some deliciously catchy songs.
