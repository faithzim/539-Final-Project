                <h3> Beartown<br>by Frederik Backman</h3>
                <img src="images/beartown.jpg"
                    alt="Cover of Beartown, boys playing hockey on a frozen lake with hills in the background.">
                <p>
                    Beartown is my most favorite novel in the world. Backman's way of writing is so easy to fall into
                    and heartbreakingly beautiful. Fair warning, this book is pretty heavy, and you should check the
                    trigger warnings before you start, but if you think you can read it, you should. It feels like
                    Backman holds your hand and wraps you in a blanket while showing the worst and best parts of life.

                <h3> The Shining<br>by Stephen King</h3>

                    alt="Cover of The Shining, an isolated hotel in the snow with a screaming face.">
                <p>
                    I would argue that the movie is more famous than King's original novel, but the novel is so much
                    better. Like Beartown, it's not for the faint of heart, and check the warnings to protect yourself,
                    but this novel is not just cheap horror. It sources its scares from the human condition and builds
                    complex characters you can understand, love, and fear.

                <h3> Almost, Maine<br>by John Cariani</h3>
                <img src="images/almost,maine.jpg"
                    alt="Cover of Almost, Maine, two people sitting on a bench in snowy woods.">
                <p>
                    I was introduced to this story through the play version (which I also recommend), but the book is
                    just as delightful. It's a kooky little story about a kooky little town with all the whimsy you need
                    for a quick winter read.

                <img src="images/diehard.jpeg" alt="Cover of Die Hard, Bruce Willis in front of an exploding building.">
                <p>
                    This classic Christmas movie (and it is a Christmas movie) is always a win. Alan Rickman and Bruce
                    Willis both knock it out of the park, and it's a must for American cultural education. Just trust
                    me. Watch it. And bonus recommendation, Die Hard 2: Die Harder also rocks.

                    alt="Cover of The Invisible Man, a woman looking forward, with a hand print on the glass behind her.">
                <p>
                    This movie is one of the best representations of domestic abuse and terror that I have ever seen.
                    The cinematography works to emphasize the horror of the unknown, or rather the unseen, placing the
                    viewer in the main character's position. This is horror as it should be, at it's most evolved.

                    alt="Cover of Violent Night, Santa with a bloody nose and a flaming candy cane.">
                <p>
                    I'm sorry to be a little repetitive with this pick, but I love this movie so much. Like Die Hard,
                    it's mostly action. When a group of naughty-listers put a little girl in danger, Santa shows up to
                    deliver a lump of coal straight to the face. This movie is not high-brow; it's not even mid-brow.
                    It's stupid, but I love it so, so much.

                <h3> Once Upon A Time </h3>

                    alt="Cover of Season 1 of Once Upon A Time, five people above a quaint town.">
                <p>
                    This is one of my favorite shows of all time. The premise is that fairy tale characters end up
                    cursed, living normal lives in Maine, and it's so incredibly whimsical. It's the perfect show to
                    curl up by the fire and binge during the dark nights.

                <p>
                    This musical is absolutely insane. 100% bonkers and worth every minute. It's a little bit spooky but
                    with all the glitz and glam that I associate with winter. This musical sparkles in the sun like snow
                    but gets dark early. It's perfect for a night out at the theater or as the soundtrack to your
                    holiday wrapping. It's based on a movie, but the musical is better.

                <p>
                    Okay, I promise I love winter, but it seems like most of my winter recs are sad. That's okay though,
                    I love this story. It's completely sung through with alternating perspectives and timings, telling
                    the story both through the songs and the very storytelling itself. The movie version is also great
                    if you can't get to the theater.
