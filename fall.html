                <p>
                    One of my favorite kids' books, Tale of Despereaux replicates the fairy-tale style with brand new
                    characters and stories. Read it to your kids or just by yourself and be sent back to a simpler time
                    when your biggest worry was no larger than a mouse.

                    alt="Cover of Reign of Shadows, dried flowers and leaves spelling out the title.">
                <p>
                    This book has fairy tale energy, starting with a very loose rapunzel retelling before diving
                    headfirst into its own world. The romance is delightful and the monsters are so wonderfully
                    ridiculous that you have to love them. A short, cute romp with an even more bonkers sequel, this
                    moody story is perfect for fall.

                <p>
                    This is a classic YA romance, but it has stood the test of time. Return, or jump ahead, to your
                    college years with a soft, feel-good story. Finding yourself and growing is hard, so join Cath as
                    she fights to figure it out. You won't feel so alone.

                <p>
                    This 2010s Disney Channel Original is a bit of a sleeper pick, but I've watched it every fall since
                    I discovered it. It's so endearing and the perfect level of spooky with beautifully terrible CGI. I
                    know that there are tons of better Halloween Disney movies out there, but this one have a very
                    special place in my heart.

                    alt="Cover of Twilight, a teenage boy and girl standing close together, the boy looking down at the girl.">
                <p>
                    While I like the books way more than the movies, the original Twilight movie has such immaculate
                    fall vibes that I can't imagine not including it on this list. From the weird blue filter over the
                    entire movie to the stormy baseball scene, this movie has become synonmous with fall. It's the
                    perfect mood setter whether you watch it ironically or completely sincerely.

                <p>
                    I'm going to cheat with this one a little bit and recommend the entire Scream franchise, but I think
                    Scream 4 in particular is criminally underrated. It won't pack the same punch if you haven't
                    seen the others, but, like all the others (except Scream 3, that one's not very good) it is so
                    clever and fun to watch and theorize through. I love this movie. I love it so much. Please watch it.

                    I love vampires (as you can probably tell) and I also love cringe-inducing young adult media
                    (also probably obvious). The Vampire Diaries combines these two loves and creates the perfect little
                    spooky, mostly vibey show. Seasons 1 and 2 are the most fall-coded, but they all make me want to
                    curl up under a blanket with some apple cider.

                    This musical's a bit heavy but is full of gorgeous music and reminds you of the beauty of humanity.
                    The sets and blocking are so simple and fun, bringing the story to life. The lesser known story of
                    9/11, a tiny town in Canada accepts thousands of plane passengers when American airspace closes.
